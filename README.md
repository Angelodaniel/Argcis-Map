# A Betty Blocks Component Toolkit

This is a component set for the [page builder](https://blog.bettyblocks.com/webinar-page-builder-part-1) of the [Betty Blocks](https://www.bettyblocks.com) platform based on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com).

## Usage

This repository contains both the component set and the required Material-UI library. You must load this dependency into your application before you can use the component set.

If the Material-UI dependency is not yet installed in your application do this, clone this repository and run:

`$ yarn bundle`

This generates a `bundle.js` file in the `dist` folder containing the Material-UI library. When it's finished, follow the next tutorial to upload this file to your bettyblocks application.
